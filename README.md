# TextCutter

TextCutter is a lightweight plugin for Figma to split or join text layers.

This plugin avoids the manual splitting of text layers and makes you work faster.

There is no UI, and it's focused on speed of interaction.

There are two commands in the plugin:

* Split text
* Join text

## How to use

* Split text
    * Select a text layer with multiple lines of text
    * Run the plugin
    * Your results (new layers) will appear on your current page in the same spot

* Join text
    * Select multiple text layers (that are underneath each other)
    * Run the plugin
    * Your results (a merged layer) will appear on the page in the same spot

## Usage

Install it via the Figma Community plugin page [here](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/739131137116544548/TextCutter)

## A tip

It is handy to assign both commands to hotkeys and use it along with OCR software that helps extract texts from images, such as [TextSniper](https://textsniper.app/).
