TextCutter is a plugin for Figma.

Watch the demo video:

I built this plugin to experiment with the Figma plugin API.

I am open sourcing this code, currently do not have time to improve it.

I would love for someone to improve upon this plugin.

There is only one outstanding feature currently:

* [ ] Layers need to remain in the same position after the plugin is ran
