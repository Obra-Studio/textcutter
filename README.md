# TextCutter

TextCutter is a lightweight plugin for Figma to split or join text layers.

You can start to use it via the [Figma Community plugin page]((https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/739131137116544548/TextCutter)).

This plugin avoids the manual splitting of multiline text layers into single text layers and makes you work faster.

There is no user interface. It's focused on speed of interaction.

Next to the core the core command “Split text”, we've added three additional commands: Join text, Split words and Remove bullets.

## How to use

* Split text
    * Select a text layer with multiple lines of text
    * Run the plugin
    * Your results (new layers) will appear on your current page in the same spot

* Join text
    * Select multiple text layers (that are underneath each other)
    * Run the plugin
    * Your results (a merged layer) will appear on the page in the same spot

* Split words
    * Select a text layer with multiple words
    * Run the "Split words" command
    * Your results (new layers for each word) will appear on your current page in the same spot

* Remove bullets
    * Select one or multiple text layers containing bullet-like characters (such as •)
    * Run the "Remove bullets" command
    * The bullets will be removed from the text

## A tip

You can use this plugin along with OCR software that helps extract texts from images based on a screenshot, such as [TextSniper](https://textsniper.app/) or [CleanShot](https://cleanshot.com/).
